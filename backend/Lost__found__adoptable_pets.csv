This is what my current foster parents have to say about me:<p/><p/>Hi, my name is Torta!<p/>I was living at a foster home with my brother Spatlo since we were both scared of humans, but we eventually learned how nice humans can be! <p/>Both me and my sibling are high energy kitties who love chasing each other and playing with toys (especially wands!). We are also highly food motivated and have been caught multiple times biting through food bags! At our foster home we did a good job of coexisting with the senior cats, outside of stealing their food at times!<p/><p/>Of the two of us, I`m the more courageous and cleverer kitty,I`m easy to handle and pick up! When I first met the older cats, my foster dad would often have to hold me back to ensure I didn`t scare them. I also have a reputation as a troublemaker as I`m the one who finds food bags and starts breaking into them! But I`m also a purry kitty who loves head scritches and lying on a warm lap! When our foster dad was using his standing desk, we would often grab onto his leg as we wanted him to sit down with us!<p/><p/>We would probably like a quieter home as we still are shy around most people and new situations. I would like to be adopted with my brother Spatlo so we can continue to play and snuggle together!<p/>",

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise.

My name is Rex. I came to RASKC after I escaped my home and was hit by a car. Unfortunately my owner was unable to care for me and surrendered me to RASKC so I could get help and find a new home. <p/><p/>I'm very sweet and gentle guy. I'm a bit on the shy side, possibly because of what I've been through. I'm not a big eater, but I'll do anything for someone to sit with me and relax. I'm ready for a new start after some bad luck! <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>",

She looks to be younger as she hasn't quite grown into her paws yet and she also has what looks to be a fresh scar from being spayed.  It's healed and looks healthy, but there is part of her scar that is still purple in color.  We took her in to have her scanned and although she is chipped we can't seem to locate the chip number anywhere and it was never registered.  So far I've run the number through the following microchip companies... International Pet Registry, Nano Chip, Petstablished, Save This Life, Smart Tag and Arf ID (Peeva)...

My name is Rojo. I came to RASKC as a stray and now I'm looking for a new home. <p/><p/>I'm a shy boy who really needs time to warm up to new people. I'm not enthusiastic about new things so I'm looking for a family that understands I will need time. Nothing is known about my past but my behavior suggests I may not have had much socialization with people. I can be nervous in new situations and would be most likely to succeed in a calm, predictable home. The way to my heart is patience, kindness and understanding. I'm sure once I bond to a new family, I'll be a loyal companion. <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",

We are also highly food motivated and have been caught multiple times biting through food bags! At our foster home we did a good job of coexisting with the senior cats, outside of stealing their food at times!<p/><p/>Of the two of us, I`m shyer and more sensitive. I may back away if directly petted, but you can often find me snuggling with your leg when you aren`t looking! And oftentimes when faced with a new situation, I wait for my sister to show it`s okay before I join in too. I can be very affectionate when it`s on my own terms, and I like to meow when I want attention. I also have an inquisitive curiosity as I love to find tiny bugs to watch! When our foster dad was using his standing desk, we would often grab onto his leg as we wanted him to sit down with us! I`m also known to give love-bites and play a bit rough with hands, but I mean well and will stop if you give me a lil `owie!`<p/>.<p/>We would probably like a quieter home as we still are shy around most people and new situations. I would like to be adopted with my sister Torta so we can continue to play and snuggle together!<p/><p/>Hi, my name is Spatlo!<p/>I was living at a foster home with my sister Torta since we were both scared of humans, but we eventually learned how nice humans can be! <p/>Both me and my sibling are high energy kitties who love chasing each other and playing with toys (especially wands!).

I would do best as the only dog in the home where I can get all the snuggles and attention to myself.<p/><p/>I weigh 61lbs and am considered a large breed dog.<p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

My name is Milka and I am available for adoption!<p/><p/>I probably haven't had too much human interaction before arriving at RASKC so I am looking for a cat savvy family that understands that I am a work in progress.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home without younger children. When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a sweet kitten who may need extra time and attention to warm up to new situations and new people. When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/>",

My name is Peanut and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on February 16, 2025 because they have too many cats. I lived in a home with other cats. <p/><p/>I can be a little shy at first, but once I warm up to you I am quite sweet. <p/><p/>When I arrived at RASKC I had an injury to my eye and needed surgery. After a little extra TLC from my caregivers and the wonderful vet staff I am on the mend and looking for my forever family.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home (fast movements and loud noises startle me). When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",

I am also very interested in playing with the resident cat, but him not so much.

Initially shy and seemingly unfamiliar with home environments, he`s made remarkable progress in adjusting to domestic life.  It took weeks for him to become comfortable with the bed, starting with curious peeks.  Cheddar is now relaxed hanging out on the bed, usually resting at the foot. He`ll move closer when seeking attention, showing his growing comfort with human interaction and affection. Cheddar enjoys pets and belly rubs but is still hesitant about kisses and being picked up.<p/>Cheddar has a fondness for toys with fake fur and he is OBSESSED with the cat toy called Da Bird , a feather wand toy.  This toy has helped him become comfortable with humans.  He enthusiastically uses scratching posts and cat trees. Cheddar has been fostered with a kitten, Brie, (A717541) who is younger than him and they have somewhat bonded because of their playful nature in a foster home with older cats.   Because of his playful nature he will do best in a home with another cat of the same age or younger.<p/>Being fostered in a home with older cats Cheddar has learned when it is okay to approach them and when he needs to back off.  Cheddar has also been fostered in a home with an 80 lbs. cat friendly dog.  He is used to and okay with having his butt sniffed and comfortable being around the dog but no real interaction between them.  Cheddar has a cute trill sound when he is playing or investigating.  The only time Ive heard him cry is when I am getting his meals ready.  Obviously encouraging me to work faster.<p/>Cheddar will need a patient, understanding family willing to give him time to bond. The reward will be sharing life with an adorable, fun-loving cat who has already shown tremendous growth in his ability to trust and connect.<p/><p/>Please check Finding4everhomes on Instagram for more photos and videos of Cheddar.<p/>https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Freel%2FDGSShttRRoO%2F%3Futm_source%3Dig_web_copy_link&data=05%7C02%7Cchameleonsvc%40kingcounty.gov%7C6ea16b2437fd4df5262408dd51816875%7Cbae5059a76f049d7999672dfe95d69c7%7C0%7C0%7C638756338430899346%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=g0askBi47XnkYc17ZiezNucNEuj2TOyw2qjB%2FAHuGDM%3D&reserved=0<p/>",

My name is Wishbone. I came to RASKC as a stray and now I'm ready to find a new home! <p/><p/>I'm a sweet but low key boy who needs time to get to know people before I get affectionate. Nothing is known about my history but my behavior suggests I may not have been well socialized. This means that everyday experiences may frighten me more than the average pup. I will need a home that understands my shyness and is willing to go at my pace. <p/><p/>I've been very loving with the staff members who frequent my kennel and spend time with me - I like to put my big head in their lap and get those sweet, sweet ear rubs. I love chicken jerky treats and will be the bravest boy possible if it means I'll get one! I keep a clean kennel and am polite for leashing. Due to my size and fearfulness, I will be most likely to succeed in a teen/adult only home where my boundaries can be easily understood and respected. <p/><p/>I weigh 60lbs and am considered a large breed dog. I am currently underweight, my new family will want to work with their vet to help me get to the proper size. <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",

She is a snuggle pup who wants to be with her person.  She's a mostly mellow girl who only needs a moderate amount of daily exercise.  She is friendly with other dogs, although smaller dogs may find her too rambunctious.  She does need a special diet for her allergies, and takes a daily medication.  She hopes to find a family who will buy her some fashionable pajamas and a nice raincoat - Rosie is a fair-weather girl!  She does cry when she's left alone so I don't think she'd be a good candidate for apartment living.""<p/><p/><p/>",

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am adaptable and love to go with the flow! <p/><p/>",

My name is Apollo. <p/><p/>I was surrendered to RASKC because my previous family could not longer care for me and now I'm looking for my new home! <p/><p/>My previous owner said that I am smart and LOVE belly rubs! I was in a home with men, women, and young children.<p/><p/>During my time at the shelter I have been in playgroups! I mostly like to run around and do my owner thing but I got along with another male husky and a younger female lab mix!<p/><p/>I'm a typical husky - busy, talkative and beautiful. Since being at RASKC, I've wanted to spend majority of my time outdoors. I may make a great hiking or camping companion this summer, I seem to really enjoy being outside and one with nature. I can be a bit aloof to start out so I'm looking for a family that is persistent in building a bond. I have a thick, heavy coat so my new family should be prepared for lots of grooming! I am most likely to succeed in an active home. <p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

I do sit to be leashed when let out of my mrun and I like treats! <p/><p/>I would do best in a home with older children.<p/><p/>I will need to find a home where someone is available for me in these early days. It is important to be consistent with me and socialize me so I can have the best companionship with people and other animals. I require patience because everything is brand new so I will need some TLC while I learn it will help tremendously on a road to success! If you and your family are ready to fall in love my awesome self, please check me out!!<p/>",

I came in with my pal Rambo. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>I weigh 60 lbs and am considered a medium breed dog.<p/>",

My name is Cassie. I came to RASKC as a stray and now I'm looking for a new home. <p/><p/>Nothing is known about my past but my scars and missing hind foot seem to suggest I may have had a rough life. I can be shy of new people and it takes awhile for me to trust, but once I do I am a calm and easy going companion. I'm highly food motivated and will snatch up treats as quickly as possible. I'm most likely to succeed in a calm and predictable home that can give me time to adjust, respect my boundaries and give me a taste of the easy life. <p/><p/>Building trust and a relationship with me will be a process but who doesn't love a good adventure? I'm sure I'll be a loyal friend to whoever takes the time to get to know me. <p/><p/>I am a gentle who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",
